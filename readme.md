Week 5 Day 5 Unit5 Assessment

In this lab, I practiced and applied unit concepts by designing a pet adoption agency database, connecting the front end to the database using Sequelize, and implementing functions to interact with the data. The setup involved downloading code, installing dependencies, and configuring the environment. I created tables with relationships, seeded the database, and developed functions to retrieve, display, and delete data. By the end, I had gained hands-on experience in database design, API development, and data management.
